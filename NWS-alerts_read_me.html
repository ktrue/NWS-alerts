  <div id="mainContent">
    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>This program is designed to get <b>all</b> alerts for one to several counties as supplied by the National Weather Service.</p>
    <p>Public alerts are acquired from the National Weather Service in the Atom Syndication Format (ATOM).<br />
      These feeds are updated about every two minutes by the NWS.</p>
    <p>Acquiring all of the alerts for a given location can be rather difficult since the NWS splits up these alerts into two groups, or codes. Severe alerts are listed in a County code and less severe alerts are in a Zone code.<br />
    Some large metropolitan areas may have several Zone codes and one County code which makes this a little more difficult to get all possible alerts for a single county.<br />
    </p>
    <p>This nws-alerts program can get all of the alerts for a desired county using two to several codes.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul class="feature">
       <li> No cron jobs are needed for one or two locations</li>
       <li>Configurable alert box for the index page</li>
       <li>Configurable big icons for the menu side bar</li>
       <li>Optional RSS Feed page</li>
       <li>Data is cached after a fresh download</li>
       <li>A Leflet map displays an outlined warning area</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Implementation - To cron or not to cron</h3>
<p>Speed is the key factor on how to configure this program.</p>
<p>To get all of the alerts for a given location, at least&nbsp;one County code and one Zone code is needed. Some locations use more than one Zone code and some locations have more than one County code, especially in mountainous regions and large metropolitan areas like Baltimore. Each code entered for a location is separately checked for possible alerts and if an alert is found, or multiple alerts are found, a link to each alert is collected and then the alert is downloaded. Each code takes a certain amount of time to check and download. The more codes to check, the longer it takes the script to process. This is where the speed comes into play to determine if you need to run the nws-alerts program using a cron job or not. </p><a name="T10" id="T10"></a>
<p>The nws-alerts program is  efficient getting these preliminary alert links. Under normal conditions it takes about one tenth of a second to search each code for an alert link. At times abnormal conditions exist on the internet such as traffic, NWS updating at time of call, NWS server readiness, etc.  The nws-alerts program will time out after 3 seconds if the data is not available and then it moves on to the next code. If abnormal conditions persist, it could take up to six seconds the load the link for each location. This seldom occurs but is possible and it would slow down the script process time. </p>
<p>After the preliminary checks for alerts, the links are gathered and the nws-alerts program will then download the complete details for each alert. If you have two or more locations that have the same alert, the nws-alerts program will only download the details once eliminating redundant downloads to save time. Again, the speed is affected by the internet traffic and conditions at the NWS.<br />
MOST OF THE TIME it takes less than a second to download the preliminary links and primary details for two locations with alerts.</p>
<p>You can view the script load time by viewing the page source. It's listed as&nbsp; Total script process time:</p>
<p><b>Recommendation:</b><br />
If you are going to use one or two locations using one Zone code and one County code for each location, then don't use the cron job and let the page visit invoke the script to get the data after the cache file expires.<br/>
Getting fresh alert data after the cache file expires will slow down loading the index page about a second. This isn't much and not that noticeable.</p>
<p>Two or more locations should use a cron job, or Windows Task Scheduler, to get the data.<br/>
This way the alert processing time will not slow down loading the index page because the alert information will always be available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="T2" id="T2"></a>
<h3>Installation &amp; Setup</h3>
    <p>Extract the nws-alerts.zip file.<br />
      There are several files, such as web pages, a data file, a configuration file, and the main file.<br />
      Icons are supplied in the folder named alert-images.<br/>
      Below is a description of the files and how to use them.</p>
    <p><b>nws-alerts.php</b> - The core file to &quot;include&quot; in your web page or to cron depending on the number of locations used.&nbsp;There is nothing to configure in this file. This file is uploaded to the web folder where your web pages are located.</p>
    <p><b>nws-alerts-config.php</b> - Configure file names, folders, alert box, icons, etc. This file is uploaded to the web folder where your web pages are located after you have made the necessary adjustments.</p>
    <p><b>nws-alerts-details-inc.php</b> - This file gathers data from the cache file and transforms it to a formatted output for the alert details. It gets 'included' into a web page.</p>
    <p><b>nws-details.php</b> - A standard details web page. It 'includes' the nws-alerts-details-inc.php file. You can also use this file as a reference on how to 'include' the nws-alerts-details-inc.php file&nbsp;in your own template theme.</p>
    <p><b>wxnws-details.php</b> - Details web page for the Saratoga Base-USA templates. It 'includes' the nws-alerts-details-inc.php file.</p>
    <p><b>nws-alerts-summary-inc.php</b> - This file gathers data from the cache file and transforms it to a formatted output for a summary of alerts page. It gets 'included' into a web page.</p>
    <p><b>nws-summary.php</b> - A standard web page to display a summary of the alerts. It 'includes' the nws-alerts-summary-inc.php file. You can also use this file as a reference on how to 'include' the nws-alerts-summary-inc.php file&nbsp;in your own template theme.</p>
    <p><b>wxadvisory.php</b> - Summary web page for the Saratoga Base-USA templates version 3 or higher. This file replaces your current file that you are using now. A switch in the Settings.php can change what gets displayed on this page. Either the nws-alerts summary data or the default atom-advisory&nbsp;data.</p>
    <p><b>nws-all-zones-inc.php</b> - This file is generated from information provided by the NWS. It contains all of the zone codes with their latitude and longitude. This file is used for getting the locations for the Leaflet map that is placed in the details page.</p>
    <p><b>nws-alerts.css</b> - this file contains the CSS to display the Leaflet map on the details page.
    <p><b>alert-images folder</b> - All icons and images are in this folder. Upload the complete folder. You may already have this folder with the same icons but there are a few images added in this updated file.</p>
    <p><b>cache folder</b> - This folder contains three cache files and one status text file used for the initial set up.<br/>
    This cache folder along with the four files are uploaded to the web site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

      The array where the county location names and Zone codes with County codes are entered.<br />
      This is described below.  <a href="#T8">Reference</a></p>
   <p><span style="color: #960;">$ourTZ = 'America/New_York'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// *** Time Zone    http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.america.php</span><br/>
    Time zone of your location. All dates and times reflect on this setting. The URL listed is where you can find the name of your time zone.<br/>
    This settings will be overridden by Settings.php entries if using the Saratoga Base-USA template set.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #960;">$cacheFileDir  = './cache/'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// default cache file directory</span><br/>
      Folder/directory where the cache files will be written and used.<br/>
    This settings will be overridden by Settings.php entries if using the Saratoga Base-USA template set.</p>
 <p><span style="color: #960;">$icons_folder = './alert-images'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// folder that contains the icons. No slash on end</span><br/>
Folder/directory that contain the icons and images used.</p>
 <p><span style="color: #960;">$cacheFileName = 'nws-alertsMainData.php'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// main data cache file name</span><br/>
Alert details are in this file and placed placed in cache folder specified at $cacheFileDir. This file will be included in the web page to display the details.</p>
 <p><span style="color: #960;">$aboxFileName = 'nws-alertsBoxData.php'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// alert box cache file name</span><br/>
Alert events and locations are in this file and placed placed in cache folder specified at $cacheFileDir. This file contains the mark up and data to display an alert box on the index page. It will be included in the index page where you want to display the alert box. Displaying the alert box is an option and explained below.</p>
 <p><span style="color: #960;">$iconFileName      = 'nws-alertsIconData.php'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// big icons cache file</span><br/>
The file name used for the big icons used in the menu side bar. It contains the location and related alert icon along with the mark up. This cache file will need to be included in side bar code. See instructions below.</p>
 <p><span style="color: #960;">$alertURL      = 'wxnws-details.php'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// web page file name for complete details</span><br/>
The file name of the web page to display the alert details for each location. The nws-alerts program uses this file name as a link when an icon or location is clicked in the alert box or the menu side bar. See instructions below.</p>
 <p>NOTE: If you are not using the Saratoga Base-USA templates, enter this file name: <span style="color: #960;">nws-details.php</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #960;">$summaryURL      = 'wxadvisory.php'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// web page for the alert summary</span><br/>

   <p><span style="color: #960;">$noCron = true; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// true=not using cron, update data when cache file expires   false=use cron to update data</span><br/>
If using one or two locations, set this to true. A cron job is not required and the cache files will update when the page is called after the cache file expires. Set this to false if using two or more locations and you will need to set up a cron job to update the cache files. This is explained above at Implementation - To cron or not to cron. Setting up a cron job is described below. <a href="#T4">Reference - Standard</a>&nbsp;  <a href="#T5"> Reference - Saratoga Base-USA</a></p>
   <p><span style="color: #960;">$updateTime = 600; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// IF $noCron=true - time span in seconds to retain cache file before updating</span><br/>
Used only if you are not using a cron job. This is the amount of time in seconds to retain the cache file in seconds. 600 equals 10 minutes.

<p><span style="color: #960;">$useAlertBox = true ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// true=use alert box &amp; write data file  &nbsp;&nbsp; false= not using alert box &amp; don't write file</span><br/>
If you are going to use the alert box, set this to true to write the cache file. If you are not going to use the alert box, set this to false and the nws-alerts program will not write this cache file.</p>
   <p><span style="color: #960;">$titleNewline = true ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// true=new line for each title&nbsp;&nbsp; false=string titles with other titles</span><br/>
If you are going to use the alert box, set this to true to create a new line for each event or location. Setting this to false will string the events/titles on the same line depending if the alert box is wide enough.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #960;">$aBox_Width = '99%'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// width of box &nbsp; Examples - $aBox_Width = '100%'; &nbsp; $aBox_Width = '850px';</span><br/>

Selectable default map type for the Leaflet map. <br/>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Setting up pages to display the data</h3>
<p>Be sure to back-up the files that are edited !</p>
<p>Before uploading all of the files, open nws-alerts-config.php and configure the $myZC  array to your locations and check/adjust all remaining settings. <br/>
  You will also need to add a few lines of code in your index page for the alert box and/or the big icons as described later on.</p>
<p><a name="T12" id="T12"></a>

Make sure the cache file exists that is entered in the config file at $cacheFileDir. If that cache file does not exist, create it. This cache folder MAY need to have the permission levels adjusted. You will notice this if you get an error message about not being able to open a file or if a file is missing.</p>
<p>After making the necessary adjustments, upload the pages and then manually execute the script to populate the cache files.<br/>
This is done by entering the following in the browsers URL bar:<br/>
<i>http://yourwebsite.com/</i><b>nws-alerts.php?mu=1</b><br/>
 You can then fine tune the settings in the config file for the alert box and menu side bar icons, if you wish to do so.<br />
NOTE: If you change a setting, it won't take affect until the script updates the cache files. This can be done if you manually update the cache files by entering&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>http://yourwebsite.com/</i><b>nws-alerts.php?mu=1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; in the URL bar of your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="T8" id="T8"></a>
<h3>$myZC set up with Zone code &amp; County code</h3>
    <p>$myZC is the array where the location and codes are entered with a pipe | separating each other.<br />
The county location name is entered first, followed by a pipe, Zone (or County) code, a pipe, Zone (or County) code, a pipe, and any other codes related to the location. Notice the double quotes encasing each location and the comma.<br/>
You can get your codes from the NWS. <a href="https://alerts.weather.gov/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;">Codes for the ATOM/CAP feeds</a>
    <br/><br/>
    <i><b>Most</b></i> counties use one Zone code and one County code. <br/>
    The following is an example of one county location with the appropriate Zone and County code:<br/>
    </p>
    <p class="codeBox">$myZC = array(&quot;Elkhart Co|INZ005|INC039&quot;);<br /></p>
    <p>This example shows how to get alerts for three counties.</p>
    <p class="codeBox">$myZC = array(<br />
&quot;Elkhart Co|INZ005|INC039&quot;,<br />
&quot;St Joe Co|INZ004|INC141&quot;,
<br />
&quot;Branch Co|MIZ080|MIC023&quot;<br />
);
<br /></p>
    <p>Some locations such as large metropolitan areas and mountainous areas use multiple Zone codes and sometimes a county can be split into multiple County codes.<br/>
    For instance, Baltimore has two Zone codes and two County codes. To get all of the alerts for Baltimore, the codes are all combined and the four codes will be separately checked.</p>
    <p class="codeBox">$myZC = array(&quot;Baltimore|MDZ006|MDZ011|MDC005|MDC510&quot;);<br /></p>
    <p>The following example is for  Baltimore and two counties:</p>
    <p class="codeBox">$myZC = array(<br />
&quot;Baltimore|MDZ006|MDZ011|MDC005|MDC510&quot;,<br />
&quot;Anne Arundel|MDZ014|MDC003&quot;,
<br />
&quot;Prince Georges|MDZ013|MDC033&quot;<br />
);
<br /></p>
    <p>NOTE: If a Zone code is the first code entered, the Leaflet map will display in the details page. If a County code is the first code entered, the Leaflet map will not display.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The FIRST code entered after the county name can not be repeated or used in another location. Any code after the first code can be used again for a different county.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Standard web page set up</h3>
<p><b>$noCron - true or false ?</b><br />
Somehow the data cache files need to be updated and that is determined by the setting $noCron in the <br />
nws-alerts-config.php file.</p>
<p>If you have a single location, you may want to set $noCron to true. When you choose 'true' for this option, the web page visit will update the cache files after the cache files have expired. The main file, nws-alerts.php, has to be included in a web page.</p>
<p><b>IF&nbsp;&nbsp; $noCron is set to true</b><br />
  Open your index file.<br/>
  Copy and paste the following line right after&nbsp; &lt;body&gt; &nbsp;(or similar):</p>
  <p class="codeBox">&lt;?php include(&quot;nws-alerts.php&quot;); ?&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p><b>IF&nbsp;&nbsp; $noCron is set to false</b><br/>
  Do not perform the steps described above.</p>
<p><i>How will the cache files update?</i><br />
  You will need to set up a cron job, use the Windows Task Scheduler, or a method that you prefer, to call the <b>nws-alerts.php</b> file at specified intervals. Since each web host has there own way of setting up a cron job, you will need to find out how to do this by getting the directions from your web host.<br />
  Using the Windows Task Scheduler has been amazingly  successful in doing this. <br />
  Sample are available here: <a href="http://www.weather.ricksturf.com//scripts/SetUp_XPcron.zip">For WinXP</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.weather.ricksturf.com//scripts/SetUp_VistaCron.zip">For WinVISTA & Windows 7</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.weather.ricksturf.com//scripts/WIN10_Task_Scheduler.zip">For WIN10</a><br />
</p>
<p>TIP: The NWS usually updates the feeds &quot;about every two minutes&quot;. MOST of the time it's done on an even minute so I suggest running a cron on an odd minute to avoid long downloads or timing out on the data cull.<br />
  If you use the Windows Task Scheduler, keep the PC time sync 'ed with the internet time.</p>

<p><b>Adding the Alert Box</b><br />
  This will place the alert box on the index page only.<br/>
  Open the php index file.<br />
  Add the following lines where you want the alert box to display: </p>
<p class="codeBox">&lt;?php<br />
// Add nws-alerts	alert box cache file<br />
include_once(&quot;nws-alerts-config.php&quot;);<br />
include($cacheFileDir.$aboxFileName);<br />
// Insert nws-alerts	alert box<br />
echo $alertBox;<br />
?&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>Save the file, close it, and then upload it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Adding big icons</b></p>
<p>The big icons can be added anywhere on a web page.<br/>
A separate cache file stores these icons and they can be displayed any way you want which depends on your html and php expertise.</p>
<p>The amount of icons depends on how many locations you have plus the setting made in the<br/>
 nws-alerts-config.php file under &nbsp;// BIG ICONS .<br/>
 Each icon is numbered and starts with the number one but again the amount of icons can vary.</p>
<p>To get all of the icons, some php code is needed and some html mark up may be added for the desired output. Below are two examples.</p>
<p>A simple way is to place the icons centered in a division like this:</p>
<p class="codeBox">
  &lt;?php <br />
  include_once(&quot;nws-alerts-config.php&quot;);  // include the config file<br />
  include($cacheFileDir.$iconFileName);   // include the big icon file<br />
  // construct icons<br />
  $bigIcos = '&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;'.&quot;\n&quot;;<br />
  foreach($bigIcons as $bigI) { <br />
$bigIcos .= $bigI;<br />
}<br />
$bigIcos .= &quot; &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- end nws-alerts icons --&gt;\n&quot;;<br />
echo $bigIcos; ?&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>Putting the icons in a table:</p>
<p class="codeBox">&lt;?php <br />
  include_once(&quot;nws-alerts-config.php&quot;); // include the config file<br />
  include($cacheFileDir.$iconFileName); // include the big icon file<br />
  // construct icons<br />
  $bigIcos = '';<br />
  $biCount = count($bigIcos);<br />
  foreach($bigIcons as $bigI) { <br />
  $bigIcos .= '&lt;td colspan=&quot;'.$biCount.'&quot;&gt;'.$bigI.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&quot;;<br />
  }<br />
  ?&gt;<br />
  &lt;table  border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;tr&gt;<br />
  &lt;?php echo $bigIcos; ?&gt;<br />
  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />
  &lt;/table&gt;<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p class="codeBox">
&lt;?php <br />
  include_once(&quot;nws-alerts-config.php&quot;);  // include the config file<br />
  include($cacheFileDir.$iconFileName);   // include the big icon file<br />
  // construct icons<br />
  $bigIcos = '';<br />
  foreach($bigIcons as $bigI) { <br />
$bigIcos .= &quot;&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=\&quot;text-align:center\&quot;&gt;&quot;.$bigI.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&quot;;<br />
}<br />
  ?&gt;<br />
&lt;table  border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;?php echo $bigIcos; ?&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />

<h3>Saratoga Base-USA set up</h3>
<p>If you are using Saratoga Base-USA&nbsp;V3, you can download a  ZIP file of updated items that will contain the necessary code and files at <a href="http://saratoga-weather.org/wxtemplates/updates.php#updates" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;">PHP/AJAX Website Template Set - Updates</a>.<br/>
Otherwise you will need to manually enter all of the following code below.</p>
<p><b>Settings.php</b><br/>
The Settings.php file needs to have some code inserted to use the nws-alerts program in other web pages.<br/>
  A switch is provided to use the nws-alerts or the default atom-top-warning/atom-advisory program.<br/>
  The location(s) and the related codes are configured here also. This will override the locations and codes <br/>
  You can see where this is placed here: <a href="http://saratoga-weather.org/wxtemplates/Settings-config-USA.php" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;">PHP/AJAX Website Template Set - Settings.php - Base-USA</a></p>
<p>Open Settings.php file.<br/>
  Copy the code below and paste it in the Settings.php file.</p>
<p class="codeBox">
  // NWS Alerts package configuration (for Curly's nws-alerts scripts) <br />
  $SITE['NWSalertsSidebar'] = true; // =true to insert in menubar, =false no insert to menubar <br /><br />

&quot;ST JOE MI|MIZ079|MIC149&quot;,<br />
&quot;BRANCH Co|MIZ080|MIC023&quot;<br />
);<br />
</p>
<p>Change the locations and Zone/County codes for the areas you want to cover. These codes can be found at the NWS web site. <a href="https://alerts.weather.gov/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;">https://alerts.weather.gov/</a></p>
<p>NOTE: If a Zone code is the first code entered, the Leaflet map will display in the details page. If a County code is the first code entered, the Leaflet map will not display.</p>
<p>NOTE: The FIRST code entered after the county name can not be repeated or used in another location. Any code after the first code can be used again for a different county.</p>
<p>After you have made the changes, save the file and close it.</p>

<p><b>Adding </b><b>Menu Items</b><br />
Open the file 
flyout-menu.xml.<br/>
<i>Be careful when editing this page!</i><br />
XML is very finicky and it will cause the page not to load if it contains any errors.<br />
The examples below are using the file names entered in the nws-alerts-config.php file at&nbsp;$summaryURL .</p>
<p>To add the RSS Feed to the menu, copy the following line and insert it where you want it to appear:</p>
<p class="codeBox"> 		&lt;item caption=&quot;RSS Feed&quot; link=&quot;nws-rssfeed.xml&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Save and close the file.<br/>
You should delete the file flyout-menu.xml that is on the web server and then upload the modified file.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><b>PHP errors:</b><br/>
The most common cause of PHP errors are the file and folder permission level settings. It will have the word &quot;permission&quot; in the error message. In this case, you will need to adjust the folder and file permission levels.</p>
<p>&quot;...failed to open stream: No such file or directory...&quot; -&nbsp; A folder or file is not set&nbsp;and needs to be created. Also this could be a file permission setting not allowing the file to be written.</p>
<p><b>Data doesn't update:</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; The NWS servers are down.&nbsp; <a href="#T10">Reference</a><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; The nws-alerts.php file is not included in a page or is not being cronned. <a href="#T4">Reference</a> <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Your web host doesn't support cURL functions.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Manually run the nws-alerts.php file and then view the page source. <a href="#T12">Reference</a><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Comments will detail the time it took to cull the data and what happened to the cache file.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>Leaflet map:</b><br/>
It does not display - <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Javascript is not enabled.<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Polygon coordinates are not provided in the alert.<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; $displaymap is not set to 1 in the file nws-alerts-config.php.<br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; A zone code for a location is not in the nws-all-zones-inc.php file.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This file is supplied by the NWS and not all locations are listed.</p>
<p>The legend shows more alerts than the outlined areas:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Alerts are overlapping with the same shape.</p>
<p>You have to zoom out to see the outlined shape of the alert:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; The Zone code is not near the County code.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set $zoomLevel&nbsp; to a lower number to zoom out further.</p>
